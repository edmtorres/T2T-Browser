<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Gene models from liftoff based on RefSeq release 110
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
This track follows the display conventions for gene prediction tracks. The exons for putative non-coding genes and untranslated regions are represented by relatively thin blocks, while those for coding open reading frames are thicker. Gene names are displayed in 'pack' or 'full' mode. More information about each gene can be found by clicking on the specific gene/transcript model.

The following color key is used:

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
This annotation was created by using the Liftoff program  (v1.6.3, with options -copies -sc 0.95 -polish -exclude_partial -chroms) to map 
  accross all human genes in RefSeq annotation release 110 from the GRCh38.p14 genome to the CHM13v2.0 genome. 
  The annotation has been manually revised for the gene annotations on the Y chromosome, to compensate ampliconic genes with additional copies not present in GRCh38.
  The annotation has been also revised to change boundaries for coding regions for 1028 transcripts, which had one or more of the following problems in the coding region: missing start, 
  missing stop, in-frame stop, or the CDS length was not divisible by 3 due to a frameshift caused by an insertion or deletion in CHM13 sequence versus GRCh38. The 1028 updated CDSs all correspond to
  complete proteins in GRCh38 RefSeq annotation and they align to their GRCh38 RefSeq counterparts.  Of the 1028 updated CDSs, 238 have coding region that is 30%+ shorter than the best matching RefSeq protein.  
  These transcript/CDS records have "Note=truncated_protein" added to the last field.
